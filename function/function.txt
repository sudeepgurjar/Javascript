                                FUNCTION


functions are used to perform a specific task.
we divide our small snippets called functions 
why functions?

---- reusuability 
---- ease to debug

syntx: 
function function_name (parameters) //line is calledfunction prototype
    {
            //function definition
    }
 function_name(arguments) // function call
 function display()
{
 console.log("hello world")
}
display()


 function are called "first class citizen" in JS

 -- function can accept values through parameters and function may returns 

 -- function can also contain defoult value in casse user doesnot pass argument in function call

 Rest and spread operators: --- is used to wrap upt the rest of the elements into one single arrar.
 --Rest operators uses three dosts
 -- Rest operators must be last in the parameter's list

 Spread operator is used to unwarp the array elements

 --- spread operator uses thee dost
 -- spread operator can be anywhere 
 usually, rest operator takes the value and spread operator splits the value 


 //function can be expressed as function  expression it means

 function newFun (){
        console.log("hii")
 }
 console.log(newFun)

//how to convert following function into function expression
function sum (a,b){
        console.log(a+b)
}

//callbacks
function are treated as variables so we can pass functions as a parameters to another function in this function which are passed as a parameter to another function is called callbacks.
